Spec: 
- Use CLI options to set ETH1 exit as this upgradeable contract - contract needs to be upgradeable
- This allows trustless staking as ETH cannot to be taken by an admin
- Disable any future migrations or minting and control minting roles
- Build a large broader community multisig with partners and set it as owner of the contract 
- Require a withdrawal queue to prevent bot arbitrage
- Create a oracle for single token value tracking for VETH2 price appreciation that can be updated with offchain calc on validators
- Bonus:
- Auto buy SGT from generated fees and send to master chef type contracts for rewards boost
- Require the user to have some SGT for solo staking or withdrawing VETH2 into ETH at a discounted market rate
- Allow the contract to be deployed via a factory allowing others to reuse the scaffolding to create their own ETH2 staking solutions i.e. staking server providers such as certus one
